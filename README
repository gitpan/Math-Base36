NAME
    Math::Base36 - Encoding and decoding of base36 strings

SYNOPSIS
      use Math::Base36 ':all';

      $b36 = encode_base36( $number );
      $number = decode_base36( $b36, $padlength );

DESCRIPTION
    This module converts to and from Base36 numbers (0..9 - A..Z)

    It was created because of an article/challenge in "The Perl Review"

METHODS
  encode_base36( $number, [$padlength] )
    Accepts a unsigned int and returns a Base36 string representation of the
    number. optionally zero-padded to $padlength.

  decode_base36( $b36 )
    Accepts a base36 string and returns a Base10 string representation of
    the number.
